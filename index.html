          <p>
            Big $oggy was born and raised in IT Sligo. Born into a family of peasants, Big $oggy had to work 25 hours a day in order to put meals on his family's table. 
            </p>  
               <p> 
           Upon finishing his brewery course in IT Sligo, he decided to pursue his life long dream of becoming a brewer. He left his family in IT Sligo and left to live a life in Brewdale.
               </p>  
            <p>But Big $oggy had no interest in working for anybody, so in 1942, he successfully opened his very own brewery in the heart of Brewdale with the money he made selling his family's house.</p>
