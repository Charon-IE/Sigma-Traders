        <b>The newest member to our team. The head Janitor found him looking for food in our company's dumpsters around back. Adam Gleebner showed impressive skill rummaging through the dumpster and so, he was hired on the spot.
            For absolutely zero pay, Adam Gleeno works 11 hour shifts, cleaning the trader's shoes and taking orders from the head Janitor.
            His hobbies include: Talking about his TY girlfriend, talking about how much he hates being top and how much he loves Frank Castle (?????????)
